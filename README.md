# Deep-Learning-with-Python-Examples

## Introduction

In this project we will reproduce the examples provided in the book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) by Fran√ßois Chollet. The book is a very good introduction to Deep Learning and Keras. It is also a good reference for more advanced users.

## Tools

We will use the following tools:

* `Python 3.6`

* `Keras 2.1.5` (with TensorFlow backend): Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

* `TensorFlow 1.6.0`: TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

* `NumPy 1.14.2`: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

    * a powerful N-dimensional array object

    * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions

    * tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code

    * useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities


* `Matplotlib 2.2.2`: Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.


To install the tools, you can use the following commands:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
